## MNRC-CONCEPT

This website concept is the final iteration of this design approach, developed for the Morley Noranda Recreation Club. 

Built using Next.js and TypeScript, with CSS modules to maintain a clear and organized file structure, it represents an early stage of development.

The project was ultimately not pursued further due to the ongoing acquisition of new techniques during production and a decision to explore a different creative direction.
