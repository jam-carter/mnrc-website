## MNRC-CONCEPT

This is a concept website for my workplace and also the last iteration for this idea

Made with NextJS and TypeScript, using CSS modules to ensure the clarity of files

This idea was not pursued further due to a combination of learning new techniques throughout the production of it, as well as  wanting to take the creative aspect in a different approach
